# Noughts_and_Crosses

A simple, two-player game of tic tac toe. Features include animations of a "referee" that depend on situation on a board, as well as option to reset a score.

Project made to practice events handling, DOM manipulation and most of all, figuring out how to translate the game logic into code.

⚙️ Technologies used:

- Event handling,
- DOM manipulation,
- Animations in CSS.
